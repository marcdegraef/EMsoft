! lattitudinal grid type:  'Lambert' or 'Legendre'
!   'Lambert' will produce a standard master pattern file that can be used
!    for dictionary indexing etc...
!   'Legendre' will produce a much smaller binary SHT-master pattern file that can only 
!    be used for spherical indexing; this file does not contain any MC data

! name of EMMCOpenCL output file to be used to copy the MC data from for this master pattern run;
! This can be used to perform multiple master pattern runs starting from the same MC data set without
! having to rerun the MC computation.  Leave this variable set to 'undefined' if not needed.

! if copyfromenergyfile is not 'undefined', then:
!   - for EMsoft developers who have the EMsoft_SDK installed, the following parameter will be ignored;
!   - all other users will need to provide the full path to the h5copy program here

! ========================================================
! =============== if latgridtype = 'Legendre' =============
